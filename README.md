# Astryx

**High-performance Coomer downloader with a local Web UI**

Astryx is a Windows-native downloader focused on **sustained throughput, reliability, and visibility** rather than burst scraping.  
It combines a high-performance backend with a real-time local Web UI.

## Project Status

Astryx is a personal / hobby project developed by an amateur programmer and released publicly as an early v0.x build; the project is actively developed and may change as the author continues learning and refining the implementation.

The codebase evolved organically to solve real-world reliability and performance
issues rather than to showcase clean architecture or idiomatic patterns.

Some areas are intentionally monolithic or redundant in favor of:
- debuggability
- predictable behavior
- sustained throughput

Refactoring and cleanup are ongoing but not a prerequisite for use.

## Features

### Local Web UI
- Runs locally at `http://127.0.0.1`
- Real-time local telemetry (queue status, host health, logs)
- No external server or cloud dependency
- Browser-based control panel

### Download Engine
- High-performance, sustained download pipeline
- Separate worker pools for:
  - **NV** — images & non-video media  
  - **VID** — video downloads
- Tunable concurrency per media type
- Designed for long-running sessions, not burst scraping

### Host Health & Routing
- Live host latency tracking
- Automatic pinning of best-performing hosts
- Graceful degradation when hosts slow or fail
- Real-time host health visualization

### Authentication
- Playwright-based login support
- Reliable handling of authenticated sessions
- Optional credential saving via **Save** toggle
- Automatic login when credentials are available

### Platform
- Windows x64
- Portable (no installer)
- No external dependencies beyond included files

## Project History

This project began as a WinForms application named `CMDownloaderUI`,
was later rebranded as `AstroFetch`,
and has since evolved into a Web UI–first application named `Astryx`.

The WinForms layer currently remains as a Windows host shell responsible for:
- process lifetime
- system integration
- orchestration of background workers

The primary user interface is the local Web UI.

## What This Project Is / Is Not

**This is:**
- A practical, Windows-native tool
- Optimized for long-running, observable workloads
- Built to solve specific problems encountered in real use

**This is not:**
- A framework
- A reference implementation
- An example of ideal or minimal C# architecture

## Safety & Privacy

- Runs entirely locally
- No external telemetry (nothing is sent off-machine)
- No cloud services
- No automatic uploads
- No bundled credentials

All network activity is user-initiated.
